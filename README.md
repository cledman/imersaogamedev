This certificate is from the mini course from [Alura](https://www.alura.com.br/) called ["Imers√£o GameDev"](https://www.alura.com.br/imersao-gamedev-javascript/) and consists on create a game (that I Named "Racer") with [P5.js](https://p5js.org/). We mainly use [P5.js](https://p5js.org/) to do that. I won the third place!

# Making of

The game was created in 2 days. So, at first, I wrote the main goals on [Trello](https://trello.com/). 
So, after that, I did the sketch of the main car:

</p>

The is the main visual from the sketch:

    <img src=".github/skt02.jpg"/>
</p>

And the final colours from that:

We can see a little from the sprite sheet of the car:

# Technologies

* [P5.js](https://p5js.org/) to handle the game, 
* [Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/br/products/photoshop.html) for the sprites and animations
* [Sonar](http://www.cakewalk.com/products/SONAR) to handle the music
* [Audacity](https://audacity.br.uptodown.com/windows) to record sound effects

# Future Implementations

* We could create more cars and make them appear dynamically
* We could have check points and a "Goal" to arrive.
* Each level could be on different location and with different weather.
